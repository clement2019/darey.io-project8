## LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION
For this project i used two Linux distribution servers of an RHEL Linux 8 Operating System they were web1, web2, they were the same web servers used 
in project 7 while the server used as load balancer was an Ec2_instances of Ubuntu version 20.04 distribution with all the configurations for free tier set up.
In this project i demonstrated the power of information technology and the ability to route traffic through the load balancer interfacing the internet.
The task was to demonstrate the ability of load shielding/distribution using the load balancer as “traffic officer”, all traffic coming from the internet
can be equally re-distrusted to the two backend webservers and this was done to great effect in this project
